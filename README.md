# pickup

This application is a webapp designed to connect members of the San Luis Obispo community through sports. Our platform allows users to post local pickup games for others in the community to see, share, and join. We hope that this application will allow users to meet new people, easily schedule events, and to stay activate in an organized and safe fashion.
